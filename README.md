### Methods Used
* Ensemble Learning
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Interpretation
* Time Series Analysis
* Model Interpretation

### Technologies
* Python 
* Plotly

* treeinterpreter 

## Project Description
In this Task Most of my attention was on data visualization and Model interpretation with the tools like treeinterpreter and PDPbox.
I came up with 3 models such as Random Forest, XGboost, Extremely randomized tree.
Which gave me nearly the same results with all that hyper parameter tuning with the score within top 10%.

## Needs of this project

- Model Evaluation
- Data Exploration/descriptive statistics
- Data Pre Processing/Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
